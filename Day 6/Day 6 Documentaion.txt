Documentation: Hackathon Marketplace Website - Day 6 (Next.js & Sanity)
This report details the progress made on Day 6 of development, focusing on environment variables, comprehensive test cases, a README file, GitHub repository structure, and the persistent Vercel deployment issue.

1. Environment Variables:

Implementation: All sensitive information, such as API keys and secret tokens, are now stored as environment variables. This enhances security by preventing these credentials from being exposed in the codebase.
Configuration: The necessary environment variables were configured for both the local development environment and the production environment (intended for Vercel deployment).
2. Comprehensive Test Cases:

Expansion: The test suite was expanded to include more comprehensive test cases, covering a wider range of scenarios and edge cases. This includes testing various user interactions, data validation, and error handling. (Provide a table similar to Day 5's test case table, but with the added test cases and their results).
Automation: (If applicable) Automated testing was implemented to streamline the testing process and ensure consistent results. Mention the testing framework used (e.g., Jest, Cypress).
3. README File:

Creation: A comprehensive README file was created for the project. This file provides essential information for anyone working with the codebase, including:
Project description
Installation instructions
Usage examples
Information about the technologies used
Contribution guidelines
Details about environment variables
Explanation of the project structure
4. GitHub Repository Structure:

Organization: The project repository on GitHub was organized to maintain a clear and logical structure. This includes:
Clearly defined folders for different parts of the application (e.g., components, pages, API routes).
Consistent naming conventions for files and folders.
A well-structured public directory for static assets.
A dedicated folder for tests.
Day 1-6 Hierarchy: The repository reflects the development process from Day 1 to Day 6, showing the evolution of the project. Commits and branches (if used) provide a clear history of the work done.
5. Vercel Deployment Issue (Ongoing):

Status: The Vercel deployment issue persists. Despite extensive troubleshooting, the root cause of the error has not yet been identified.
Further Investigation: The following steps are planned for further investigation:
Detailed analysis of the Vercel build logs, focusing on any specific error messages or warnings.
Comparison of the local development environment configuration with the Vercel environment.
Testing with a minimal reproduction of the issue to isolate the problem.
Seeking support from the Vercel community or support team.
Alternative Deployment Options: As a contingency, alternative deployment platforms (e.g., Netlify, AWS Amplify) are being considered in case the Vercel issue cannot be resolved in a timely manner.
Note for Giaic Teachers:

The core functionality of the website is complete and thoroughly tested in the local development environment. The remaining challenge is the Vercel deployment error, which I am actively working to resolve.  I have implemented the necessary environment variables, comprehensive test cases, and a detailed README file.  The GitHub repository is well-structured and reflects the progress made throughout the development process.  I am exploring alternative deployment solutions as a backup.  I can demonstrate the fully functional website in my local environment at any time. I understand the importance of the deadline and am committed to making the website accessible online as soon as possible.
